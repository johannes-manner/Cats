# JAX-RS REST API

*Sample projects using JAX-RS technologies.*

Use `gradlew run` to start the JAX-RS server.
The server is available at `localhost:9999/v1` per default. 
This can be configured via `src/main/resources/config.properties`.

To discover the different resources, methods and data schemas, have a look at the file `src/main/resources/openapi.yaml` which you can also open in 
[Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/#).

In addition, [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) is added to this project and you can access it at: [`http://localhost:9999/v1/swagger-ui/index.html?url=openapi.yaml`](http://localhost:9999/v1/swagger-ui/index.html?url=openapi.yaml) per default.
